# PluginAppDemo
Shell App Demo with dynamic plugins registration

Based on SimpleInjector IoC and DevExpress WPF components.

Plugin projects do not depend on Shell project.
So you have to Build Solution (F6) after plugin modification.

A plugin project has a post-build event with command:

  copy /Y "$(TargetPath)" "$(SolutionDir)\$(SolutionName)\$(OutDir)"
